> aspiring engineer, recovering perfectionist, learning to build instead of just observe  

Hi, I’m Jamie—currently plotting a late-bloomer tech takeover. Ex-lab girl turned CS student, software-engineer-in-training, and full-time systems-thinker (in life and code).

For the past few years, I’ve been the founder and ops engine behind Collab Gal, a fractional support biz helping creatives and small business owners clean up their chaos and scale sustainably. From automation to copy strategy to process design—I’ve lived in the backend of other people’s dreams, and now I’m chasing my own.

I’m here to build smarter systems—for work, for life, and maybe even for the internet we actually want to live on.

### 🧠 What I'm Learning
- Python & JavaScript basics  
- Core CS Principles, Algorithms, Pre-Calc  
- Cybersecurity & Computer Network Systems (CNSE)

### 🛠️ Projects In Progress
- `barflow.js`: workflow tool for mobile bartenders to streamline inquiries, bookings & confirmations (because vibes > spreadsheets)  
- `eventPrepGen`: an AI-powered prompt system that auto-generates shopping lists + cocktail specs based on event details  
- `pourReport.py`: data tracker that logs event metrics like guest count, drink volume, and time-per-pour for better pricing & staffing decisions  
- `bartendStack`: a curated Zapier/Notion/Airtable combo that turns chaos into smooth service for service pros  

### ⚙️ What I Value
- Human-centered tech that challenges broken systems  
- Creative problem-solving over rigid credentialism  
- Encouraging more women and late-starters to take up space in tech
